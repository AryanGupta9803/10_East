While I have made my best attempt at reverse engineering the webiste, 
I can concur that this is not a very good code in itself.

Disclaimer: Most of the JS code is UNREADABLE. 
It has a lot of numbers and letters that i have no clue about.
I have found several clues that point to this website being built 
in Sanity.io, which would imply most of the above.
It would also mean that it is not meant to reverse engineered in 
node js & tailwind css.

Do note that, before this excercise, I had never used rudimentry
Node.js or Tailwind-Css. I only had experiernce in vue.js as 
I'm a BZA student and not a CS student.
And for the life of me I couldn't figure why the main page
would even need Django cuz there's no API calls.

If the idea is to test my SWE skills, I can recreate 
the website using vue.js in a week. Although, my abilities 
would not be fully utilized as Software Engineer.
